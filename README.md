# Grobner-bases
This project aims to compute multivariate differential dimension grobner bases.
This work was supported by the NSF grant CCF-1714425 and has been accomplished in guidance of Dr. ALexander Boris Levin.
In order to compute grobner bases. 
You need to download all three files.(mono.py, Poly.py, Module.py)

This program contains the general functions to generate Grobner bases
with respect to modules, polynomials and monomials.

Module.py works as the main file.
Run Module.py and input your desired operations to compute grobner bases.

New_mono is the most updated program for the difference dimension grobner bases.
