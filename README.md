# Grobner-bases
This project aims to compute grobner bases with respect to several term orders in modules.

In order to compute grobner bases. 
You need to download all three files.(mono.py, Poly.py, Module.py)

This program contains the general functions to generate Grobner bases
with respect to modules, polynomials and monomials.

Module.py works as the main file.
Run Module.py and input your desired operations to compute grobner bases.
