# Gröbner-Bases
This project aims to compute Multivariable Differential Dimension Gröbner Bases.
This work was supported by the NSF grant CCF-1714425 and has been accomplished in guidance of Dr. ALexander Boris Levin.

--> For the computation of Gröbner Bases with Respect to Several Orderings and Multivariable Dimension Modules.

You need to download all three files.(mono.py, Poly.py, Module.py)

This program contains the general functions to generate Gröbner Bases with respect to modules, polynomials and monomials.

Module.py works as the main file.

Run Module.py and input your desired operations to compute Gröbner Bases.

--> For the computation of Gröbner Bases with Respect to Several Orderings and Multivariable Dimension Polynomials of Difference Modules.

You only need to download (differenceGröbner.py)

This program contains the general functions to generate Gröbner Bases with respect to modules, polynomials and monomials.

Run differenceGröbner.py and input your desired operations to compute Gröbner Bases.

differenceGröbner.py is the most updated program for the computation of Gröbner Bases.
